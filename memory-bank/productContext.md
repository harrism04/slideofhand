# Product Context

## Problem Solved

POP Presentation Pro solves the problem of fragmented and often stressful presentation preparation. Many individuals struggle with:
- **Content Creation**: Difficulty in structuring thoughts, generating engaging content, and designing slides.
- **Practice & Delivery**: Lack of effective tools to practice delivery, identify areas for improvement (like pacing, filler words), and build confidence.
- **Feedback Loop**: Absence of immediate, actionable feedback to refine their presentation skills.
- **Tracking Progress**: Inability to track improvement over time and understand how their skills are evolving.

The project aims to consolidate these aspects into a single, user-friendly platform.
