# Progress

## What Works
- **Core Application Setup**: Next.js, Supabase client configured.
- **Basic Page Rendering & Navigation**.
- **Supabase Client Initialization**: Confirmed to be using correct environment variables.
- **Explicit User Authentication UI**:
    - `@supabase/auth-ui-react` and `@supabase/auth-ui-shared` packages installed.
    - `/auth` page created with Supabase Auth UI.
    - `AuthStatus` component created and integrated into `app/page.tsx` header for login/logout display.
- **Client-Side Auth State**: `AuthStatus` component correctly reflects login/logout.
- **Server-Side Session Management (SSR)**:
    - **Client-Side (`utils/supabase-client.ts`)**: Updated to use `createBrowserClient` from `@supabase/ssr`. This was the **key fix** that enabled cookie-based session persistence on the client, allowing sessions to be shared with the server.
    - **Middleware (`middleware.ts`)**: Correctly configured with `createServerClient` to read and refresh session cookies.
    - **API Routes (e.g., `app/api/generate-presentation/route.ts`)**: Correctly configured with `createServerClient` to access user sessions via cookies.
- **AI Slide Generation (`/api/generate-presentation`)**: Now working correctly with authenticated user sessions, resolving previous RLS violations for the `slides` table.
- **`createPresentation` Service**: Updated to include `user_id` for authenticated users.
- **`savePracticeSession` Service**: Updated to include `user_id` (for authenticated users).
- **Practice Mode (`/practice` page)**:
    - Implemented auto-save for practice sessions. Sessions are now saved automatically after recording and analysis.
- **Performance Analysis & History (`/history` page)**:
    - Resolved runtime error in `components/performance-chart.tsx` by removing "engagement" score.
    - Corrected TypeScript errors in `components/performance-chart.tsx` by explicitly typing `PracticeSession.analysis` as `AnalysisResult | null` in `services/practice-service.ts`.
- **"Thinking" Progress UI for AI Operations**:
    - Implemented a new stepwise progress indicator (`components/ui/ThinkingProgress.tsx`) for presentation creation and practice analysis.
    - Uses a `Card`-based UI with `TypewriterText` for active steps, simulating progress as backend APIs are not streaming.
    - Integrated into `app/create/loading.tsx` and `app/practice/loading.tsx`.
- **PDF Import**: Functionality for importing presentations from PDF files is working.
- **Branding**: Replaced text logo with image logo (`soh.png`) in `app/page.tsx` header.

## What's Left to Build / In Progress
- **Performance Analysis & History (`/history` page)**:
    - Verify the page loads correctly and charts display as expected after recent fixes.
- **Full RLS Implementation & Testing (Ongoing)**:
    - **`practice_sessions` table RLS**: Needs testing with authenticated users to ensure `savePracticeSession` (both manual and auto-save) works correctly.
    - **`recordings` storage bucket RLS**: Needs configuration and testing for authenticated users.
- **Presentation Creation & Editing (`/create` page)**:
    - Full functionality of the slide editor (beyond AI generation).
    - Verify PDF import functionality.
- **Practice Mode (`/practice` page)**:
    - Thorough testing of the new auto-save feature under various conditions.
    - Full testing of saving practice sessions (manual and auto), including audio upload and analysis, with authenticated users and correct RLS.
- **User Experience**: Consistent Pop Art design, responsiveness.
    - Test the new `ThinkingProgress` UI in both flows to ensure it feels right and matches the project aesthetic.
- **Error Handling & Testing**: Comprehensive strategy.
- **Favicon**.
- **Logging Cleanup**: Consider reducing or removing the extensive debugging logs added to `middleware.ts` and `app/api/generate-presentation/route.ts`.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Feature Refinement & Bug Fixing.
- **Overview**: PPTX import has been temporarily disabled due to persistent build issues with its dependencies. PDF import remains functional. The critical issue of `null` sessions in API routes has been **resolved**. AI slide generation is functional. The runtime error on the `/history` page related to "engagement score" has been fixed. A new "Thinking" progress UI has been implemented for AI operations. The header logo in `app/page.tsx` has been updated. The focus shifts to verifying existing functionality (PDF import, `/history` page), testing RLS-dependent features, UX testing of the new progress UI, and continuing development.
- The Memory Bank has been updated.

## Known Issues
- **PPTX Import Disabled**: Temporarily removed due to build errors with `@saltcorn/docling` and its dependencies.
- **Original RLS Violation on `practice_sessions` (Needs Re-testing)**: This needs to be re-tested now that the primary session propagation issue is resolved.
- **Favicon Missing**.
- **`/history` Page Verification**: Needs to be checked to ensure it loads correctly after the recent fixes.
- **"Import Presentation" Button Commented Out**: The button and its functionality in `app/presentations/page.tsx` are temporarily disabled by commenting out the relevant code.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Shifted from anonymous user sessions to explicit user authentication.
- Implemented `middleware.ts` for server-side session refreshing.
- **Resolved `null` session issue in API routes by correcting the client-side Supabase initialization to use `createBrowserClient` for cookie-based SSR authentication.** This was the crucial step.
- RLS policies for `authenticated` users (using `auth.uid()`) are now expected to work correctly as the session context is properly passed.
- Decided to temporarily disable PPTX import due to unresolved dependency issues, focusing on maintaining PDF import functionality.
