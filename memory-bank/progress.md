# Progress

## What Works
- **Core Application Setup**: Next.js, Supabase client configured.
- **Basic Page Rendering & Navigation**.
- **Supabase Client Initialization**: Confirmed to be using correct environment variables.
- **Explicit User Authentication UI**:
    - `@supabase/auth-ui-react` and `@supabase/auth-ui-shared` packages installed.
    - `/auth` page created with Supabase Auth UI.
    - `AuthStatus` component created and integrated into `app/page.tsx` header for login/logout display.
- **Client-Side Auth State**: `AuthStatus` component correctly reflects login/logout.
- **Server-Side Session Management (SSR)**:
    - **Client-Side (`utils/supabase-client.ts`)**: Updated to use `createBrowserClient` from `@supabase/ssr`. This was the **key fix** that enabled cookie-based session persistence on the client, allowing sessions to be shared with the server.
    - **Middleware (`middleware.ts`)**: Correctly configured with `createServerClient` to read and refresh session cookies. Implemented route protection to redirect unauthenticated users to `/auth` for all pages except `/` and `/auth/**`.
    - **API Routes (e.g., `app/api/generate-presentation/route.ts`)**: Correctly configured with `createServerClient` to access user sessions via cookies.
- **AI Slide Generation (`/api/generate-presentation`)**: Now working correctly with authenticated user sessions (using OpenAI gpt-4o-mini), resolving previous RLS violations for the `slides` table.
- **AI Transcription & Analysis**:
    - GROQ API (groq-whisper-large-v3-turbo) integrated for speech-to-text transcription.
    - OpenAI API (gpt-4o-mini) integrated for comprehensive analysis of transcriptions and feedback generation.
- **`createPresentation` Service**: Updated to include `user_id` for authenticated users.
- **`savePracticeSession` Service**: Updated to include `user_id` (for authenticated users).
- **Practice Mode (`/practice` page)**:
    - Implemented auto-save for practice sessions. Sessions are now saved automatically after recording and analysis.
    - **Implemented Full-Screen Slide Mode**: Users can now toggle a full-screen view of the current slide within the standard practice page. Controls remain accessible.
- **`components/slide-preview.tsx`**: Updated to support an `isFullscreen` prop, adjusting its layout and font sizes for optimal full-screen display.
- **Performance Analysis & History (`/history` page)**:
    - Resolved runtime error in `components/performance-chart.tsx` by removing "engagement" score.
    - Corrected TypeScript errors in `components/performance-chart.tsx` by explicitly typing `PracticeSession.analysis` as `AnalysisResult | null` in `services/practice-service.ts`.
- **"Thinking" Progress UI for AI Operations**:
    - Implemented a new stepwise progress indicator (`components/ui/ThinkingProgress.tsx`) for presentation creation and practice analysis.
    - Uses a `Card`-based UI with `TypewriterText` for active steps, simulating progress as backend APIs are not streaming.
    - Integrated into `app/create/loading.tsx` and `app/practice/loading.tsx`.
- **File Import (Disabled)**: All file import functionality (PDF and PPTX) is currently disabled to resolve Vercel build issues. The `pdf-parse` dependency was removed.
- **Branding**: Replaced text logo with image logo (`soh.png`) in `app/page.tsx` header.
- **Interactive Q&A Practice Mode (Backend)**:
    - `services/groq-service.ts` updated with `synthesizeSpeechGroq` for TTS.
    - `services/openai-service.ts` updated with `generateChatResponseOpenAI` for AI text responses.
    - New API route `app/api/interactive-chat/route.ts` created to orchestrate AI text and speech generation.
    - `services/practice-service.ts` updated with `getInteractiveChatResponse` to call the new API route.
- **Interactive Q&A Practice Mode (Frontend - Initial Implementation)**:
    - `app/practice/select/page.tsx` updated to link to the new interactive mode.
    - `app/practice/interactive/[presentationId]/page.tsx` created with core UI and logic.
- **Logging Cleanup**: Reduced verbose logging in `app/api/generate-presentation/route.ts`. (Logging in middleware.ts was already minimal but the protection logic was added).

## What's Left to Build / In Progress
- **Test Full-Screen Mode (Standard Practice)**: Thoroughly test the new full-screen slide mode in `app/practice/page.tsx`.
    - Verify layout adjustments, control visibility and functionality, and slide rendering in both normal and full-screen states.
    - Check for any visual glitches or usability issues.
- **Test Route Protection**: Thoroughly test the new authentication protection in `middleware.ts`.
    - Verify that unauthenticated users are redirected to `/auth` from protected pages.
    - Verify that authenticated users can access protected pages.
    - Verify that `/` and `/auth/**` remain accessible to everyone.
- **Consider Full-Screen for Interactive Q&A**: Evaluate implementing a similar full-screen slide toggle for `app/practice/interactive/[presentationId]/page.tsx`.
- **Interactive Q&A Practice Mode (Frontend - Testing & Refinement)**:
    - Thoroughly test the new `app/practice/interactive/[presentationId]/page.tsx`.
    - Debug any issues with chat functionality, audio recording/playback, transcription, AI responses, and slide navigation.
    - Refine UI/UX based on testing.
    - Updated color scheme to align with `app/practice/page.tsx`: light blue page background (`bg-blue-50`), yellow header, pop-art styled cards with distinct shadows, and updated component colors (buttons, chat bubbles, text inputs) to match the overall product branding.
- **Performance Analysis & History (`/history` page)**:
    - Verify the page loads correctly and charts display as expected after recent fixes.
- **Full RLS Implementation & Testing (Ongoing)**:
    - **`practice_sessions` table RLS**: Needs testing with authenticated users to ensure `savePracticeSession` (both manual and auto-save) works correctly.
    - **`recordings` storage bucket RLS**: Needs configuration and testing for authenticated users.
- **Presentation Creation & Editing (`/create` page)**:
    - Full functionality of the slide editor (beyond AI generation).
    - File import functionality is disabled.
- **Practice Mode (`/practice` page)**:
    - Thorough testing of the new auto-save feature under various conditions.
    - Full testing of saving practice sessions (manual and auto), including audio upload and analysis, with authenticated users and correct RLS.
- **User Experience**: Consistent Pop Art design, responsiveness.
    - Test the new `ThinkingProgress` UI in both flows to ensure it feels right and matches the project aesthetic.
- **Error Handling & Testing**: Comprehensive strategy.
- **Favicon**.

## Current Status
- **Phase**: Authentication & Feature Enhancement.
- **Overview**: Implemented route protection in `middleware.ts`. Implemented full-screen slide mode for the standard practice page (`app/practice/page.tsx`). Backend for Interactive Q&A is complete. Frontend implementation for Interactive Q&A mode has begun. All file import functionality (PPTX and PDF) is now disabled to resolve Vercel build errors; `pdf-parse` dependency removed. Core AI functionalities for standard practice are operational. The `null` session issue is resolved. Focus is now on testing the new route protection and full-screen mode, and continuing with the Interactive Q&A frontend.
- The Memory Bank has been updated to reflect accurate AI service usage, the new interactive Q&A backend, the new full-screen mode, the disabling of file imports, and the new route protection.

## Known Issues
- **All File Imports Disabled**: PPTX and PDF import functionalities are temporarily disabled to resolve Vercel build errors.
- **Original RLS Violation on `practice_sessions` (Needs Re-testing)**: This needs to be re-tested now that the primary session propagation issue is resolved.
- **`/history` Page Verification**: Needs to be checked to ensure it loads correctly after the recent fixes.
- **"Import Presentation" Button Commented Out**: The button and its functionality in `app/presentations/page.tsx` are temporarily disabled by commenting out the relevant code.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
- Shifted from anonymous user sessions to explicit user authentication.
- Implemented `middleware.ts` for server-side session refreshing and route protection.
- **Resolved `null` session issue in API routes by correcting the client-side Supabase initialization to use `createBrowserClient` for cookie-based SSR authentication.** This was the crucial step.
- RLS policies for `authenticated` users (using `auth.uid()`) are now expected to work correctly as the session context is properly passed.
- Decided to temporarily disable all file imports (PPTX and PDF) due to unresolved dependency and Vercel build issues.
- Implemented full-screen slide display as a toggle within the existing standard practice page, rather than a separate route.
