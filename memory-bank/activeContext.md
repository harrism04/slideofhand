# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- **Implemented Full-Screen Slide Mode in Standard Practice**:
  - Modified `app/practice/page.tsx` to include a toggle for full-screen display of the current slide.
  - Added a new state `isSlideFullscreen` to manage this mode.
  - Updated the layout to conditionally hide/show elements (header, sidebars) and resize the slide preview area.
  - Adapted recording and navigation controls to remain functional and accessible in full-screen mode, typically as an overlay at the bottom.
  - Added `Maximize` and `Minimize` icons from `lucide-react`.
  - Updated `components/slide-preview.tsx` to accept an `isFullscreen` prop and adjust its internal styling (font sizes, padding, image sizing) accordingly for better full-screen presentation.
- **Disabled ALL File Imports (PPTX & PDF)**:
  - PPTX import was previously disabled due to build errors with `@saltcorn/docling`.
  - PDF import has now also been disabled by removing the `pdf-parse` dependency and updating related code to resolve Vercel build errors.
  - All file import functionality is currently unavailable.
- **Implemented Auto-Save for Practice Sessions**: Practice sessions in `app/practice/page.tsx` are now automatically saved after recording and analysis are complete.
- **RESOLVED**: The persistent `null` session issue in Next.js API routes (e.g., `/api/generate-presentation`) that was preventing slide creation due to RLS violations has been resolved.
- AI-generated slide creation is now working correctly.
- **Implemented "Thinking" Progress UI**: Created a new stepwise progress indicator for long-running AI operations.
  - New component: `components/ui/ThinkingProgress.tsx` - Displays a card-based, step-by-step progress UI with optional typewriter text for active steps.
  - New component: `components/ui/TypewriterText.tsx` - A reusable component for animating text display.
  - Integrated into `app/create/loading.tsx` for presentation creation.
  - Integrated into `app/practice/loading.tsx` for practice session analysis.
  - This UI simulates progress based on predefined steps and durations, as backend APIs are not currently streaming.
- **Commented out "Import Presentation" button**: The "Import Presentation" button and its dialog functionality in `app/presentations/page.tsx` have been commented out.
- **Branding Update**: Replaced the text logo "POP Presentation Pro" with the `soh.png` image logo in the header of `app/page.tsx`.
- **Interactive Q&A Practice Mode (Backend)**:
    - Implemented backend services and API route for a new interactive Q&A practice mode.
    - This mode will allow users to have a spoken conversation with an AI, relevant to their slide content.
- **Interactive Q&A Practice Mode (Frontend - Initial Implementation)**:
    - Updated `app/practice/select/page.tsx` to include an option to start "Interactive Q&A" mode, linking to `/practice/interactive/[presentationId]`.
    - Created `app/practice/interactive/[presentationId]/page.tsx` with the basic UI structure, state management, and core logic for fetching presentation data, handling chat (text and voice via transcription), playing AI audio responses, and slide navigation.
- **Logging Cleanup**: Reduced verbose logging in `middleware.ts` and `app/api/generate-presentation/route.ts`.
- **Route Protection**: Implemented route protection in `middleware.ts` to redirect unauthenticated users to `/auth` for all pages except `/` and `/auth/**`.

    - Explicitly typed the `analysis` field in `PracticeSession` and `PracticeSessionWithDetails` as `AnalysisResult | null` to resolve TypeScript errors in `performance-chart.tsx`.
- **`app/presentations/page.tsx`**:
    - Commented out the `<Dialog>` component responsible for the "Import Presentation" button and its functionality (remains commented out).
- **`app/api/import-presentation/route.ts`**:
    - Removed `pdf-parse` import.
    - Modified logic to disable both PDF and PPTX imports, returning a 503 error for these file types.
- **`app/create/page.tsx`**:
    - Changed the "Import from PDF" button text to "Import (Disabled)" and set the button to `disabled`.
- **`components/file-upload.tsx`**:
    - Changed the default `acceptedFileTypes` prop to `""` (empty string).
    - Updated the "No file selected" toast description to be generic ("Please select a file.").
- **`components/ui/ThinkingProgress.tsx`**: Created new component.
- **`components/ui/TypewriterText.tsx`**: Created new component.
- **`app/create/loading.tsx`**: Integrated `ThinkingProgress` for presentation creation flow.
- **`app/practice/loading.tsx`**: Integrated `ThinkingProgress` for practice analysis flow.
- **`app/page.tsx`**:
    - Replaced the `<h1>` text logo with an `<Image src="/soh.png" ... />` component wrapped in a `<Link href="/">`.
    - Imported `next/image`.
- **`utils/supabase-client.ts`**:
    - Modified to use `createBrowserClient` from `@supabase/ssr` instead of `createClient` from `@supabase/supabase-js`. This was the **key fix** to enable cookie-based session management on the client-side, allowing the session to be shared with server-side components (middleware and API routes).
- **`middleware.ts`**:
    - Enhanced logging was added to trace cookie handling and Supabase user session retrieval. This logging confirmed that Supabase auth cookies were initially missing from incoming requests.
    - Updated to include redirection logic for unauthenticated users. Public paths are defined as `/` and `/auth/**`. Unauthenticated access to other paths redirects to `/auth`.
- **`app/api/generate-presentation/route.ts`**:
    - Enhanced logging was added to trace incoming cookies and session state. This also initially showed missing auth cookies and a null session.
- **`components/performance-chart.tsx`**:
    - Removed references to "engagement" score to fix a runtime error.
- **`readme.md`**:
    - Updated AI integration details to reflect GROQ usage for transcription and OpenAI's expanded role in transcription analysis and feedback generation.
    - Updated environment variable requirements to include `GROQ_API_KEY`.
- **Memory Bank Documentation Update (Project-wide)**:
    - Corrected outdated information regarding AI service utilization across `projectbrief.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` based on user feedback. This ensures the Memory Bank accurately reflects current implementation.
      - `projectbrief.md`: Updated "AI Integration" and "Integrations" sections.
      - `systemPatterns.md`: Updated "AI Integration", "Interaction Flow for Analysis", "Key Technical Decisions", "Component Relationships", and "Critical Implementation Paths".
      - `techContext.md`: Updated "AI Services", "Environment Variables", "Technical Constraints", and "AI SDKs/Clients".

## Next Steps (When Resuming)
- **Test Full-Screen Mode**: Thoroughly test the new full-screen slide mode in `app/practice/page.tsx`.
    - Verify layout adjustments, control visibility and functionality, and slide rendering in both normal and full-screen states.
    - Check for any visual glitches or usability issues.
- **Test Route Protection**: Thoroughly test the new authentication protection in `middleware.ts`.
    - Verify that unauthenticated users are redirected to `/auth` from protected pages.
    - Verify that authenticated users can access protected pages.
    - Verify that `/` and `/auth/**` remain accessible to everyone.
- **Consider Full-Screen for Interactive Q&A**: Evaluate implementing a similar full-screen slide toggle for `app/practice/interactive/[presentationId]/page.tsx`.
- **Verify `/history` Page**: Check if the `/history` page now loads correctly without errors after the changes to `performance-chart.tsx` and `practice-service.ts`.
- **Test Auto-Save Functionality**: Thoroughly test the new auto-save feature in `app/practice/page.tsx` under various conditions (e.g., successful transcription/analysis, mock/error transcription).
- **Test `savePracticeSession` (manual and auto)**: Verify that saving practice sessions also works correctly with the authenticated user context and RLS policies for both manual and automatic saves.
- **Verify RLS Policies for `recordings` Storage Bucket**: Ensure appropriate RLS is in place for authenticated users.
- **Implement Frontend for Interactive Q&A Practice Mode**:
    - **Initial page created (`app/practice/interactive/[presentationId]/page.tsx`) with core UI and logic.**
    - **Selection flow updated in `app/practice/select/page.tsx`.**
    - Next: Thorough testing, bug fixing, and UI refinement for this new page.
    - Ensure all aspects (chat display, voice input, transcription, AI interaction, audio playback, slide navigation) function correctly.
- **Styling Update for Interactive Q&A Page**: Changed the color scheme of `app/practice/interactive/[presentationId]/page.tsx` to align with `app/practice/page.tsx`. This includes a light blue page background (`bg-blue-50`), yellow header, pop-art styled cards with distinct shadows for slide display and chat, and updated component colors (buttons, chat bubbles, text inputs) to match the overall product branding.
- **Continue with other pending tasks** as outlined in `progress.md`.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- Full-screen slide mode implemented as a toggle within the existing standard practice page.
- All file imports (PPTX and PDF) are now disabled to resolve Vercel build errors. The `pdf-parse` dependency has been removed.
- Backend for interactive Q&A practice mode is complete, using OpenAI for text generation and Groq PlayAI TTS for speech.
- The core issue regarding `null` session was the client-side Supabase client not being configured for cookie-based SSR authentication.
- The server-side setup (`middleware.ts` and API routes using `createServerClient`) was largely correct but depended on the client sending the auth cookies.
- Route protection is implemented in `middleware.ts` by checking the user's session and redirecting if necessary, while allowing access to defined public paths.

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- For Next.js applications using Supabase SSR features (middleware, API routes needing auth context), it's crucial to use:
    - `createBrowserClient` (from `@supabase/ssr`) for the client-side Supabase instance.
    - `createServerClient` (from `@supabase/ssr`) for server-side instances (in middleware, API routes, Server Components).
- This ensures consistent cookie-based session management across client and server.
- Conditionally styling components for different view modes (e.g., normal vs. full-screen) using state and Tailwind CSS.

## Learnings & Project Insights
- Dependency issues in third-party libraries (like `pdf-parse` and its own dependencies like `debug`) can be complex to resolve within a specific build environment (Next.js/Webpack/pnpm/Vercel). Removing the problematic dependency was the chosen solution for Vercel build stability.
- The choice of Supabase client initialization (`createClient` vs. `createBrowserClient`) is critical for how sessions are persisted (localStorage vs. cookies) and shared in a Next.js SSR context.
- When debugging auth issues, tracing the presence and flow of authentication cookies from the browser through to server-side request handlers is essential.
- RLS policies rely on a valid authenticated session being available to the database. If the session is `null` at the API route level, RLS will typically block operations.
- Ensuring consistent and explicit typing for data structures, especially those derived from database `JSONB` fields (like `practice_sessions.analysis`), is crucial for preventing runtime and type errors in consuming components.
- **Documentation Accuracy**: Promptly updating the Memory Bank and project documentation (like `readme.md`) upon receiving clarifying feedback or making significant architectural changes is vital for maintaining a reliable source of truth.
