# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
- **Disabled PPTX Import**: Due to persistent build errors with `@saltcorn/docling` and its dependencies (`underscore`, `package.json` resolution issues), the PPTX import functionality has been temporarily disabled.
  - PDF import functionality remains active as it uses `pdf-parse`, which is working correctly.
- **Implemented Auto-Save for Practice Sessions**: Practice sessions in `app/practice/page.tsx` are now automatically saved after recording and analysis are complete.
- **RESOLVED**: The persistent `null` session issue in Next.js API routes (e.g., `/api/generate-presentation`) that was preventing slide creation due to RLS violations has been resolved.
- AI-generated slide creation is now working correctly.
- **Implemented "Thinking" Progress UI**: Created a new stepwise progress indicator for long-running AI operations.
  - New component: `components/ui/ThinkingProgress.tsx` - Displays a card-based, step-by-step progress UI with optional typewriter text for active steps.
  - New component: `components/ui/TypewriterText.tsx` - A reusable component for animating text display.
  - Integrated into `app/create/loading.tsx` for presentation creation.
  - Integrated into `app/practice/loading.tsx` for practice session analysis.
  - This UI simulates progress based on predefined steps and durations, as backend APIs are not currently streaming.
- **Commented out "Import Presentation" button**: The "Import Presentation" button and its dialog functionality in `app/presentations/page.tsx` have been commented out.
- **Branding Update**: Replaced the text logo "POP Presentation Pro" with the `soh.png` image logo in the header of `app/page.tsx`.

## Recent Changes
- **`app/presentations/page.tsx`**:
    - Commented out the `<Dialog>` component responsible for the "Import Presentation" button and its functionality.
- **`app/api/import-presentation/route.ts`**:
    - Commented out `import { extract } from '@saltcorn/docling';`.
    - Modified the `else if (fileType === 'application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.presentationml.presentation')` block to return a 503 error, disabling PPTX import.
    - Updated the final `else` block's error message to specify "Unsupported file type. Please upload a PDF file."
- **`app/create/page.tsx`**:
    - Changed the "Import from PDF/PPTX" button text to "Import from PDF".
    - Updated the import dialog description to only mention PDF files.
- **`components/file-upload.tsx`**:
    - Changed the default `acceptedFileTypes` prop to `'.pdf,application/pdf'`.
    - Updated the "No file selected" toast description to "Please select a PDF file to import."
- **`components/ui/ThinkingProgress.tsx`**: Created new component.
- **`components/ui/TypewriterText.tsx`**: Created new component.
- **`app/create/loading.tsx`**: Integrated `ThinkingProgress` for presentation creation flow.
- **`app/practice/loading.tsx`**: Integrated `ThinkingProgress` for practice analysis flow.
- **`app/practice/page.tsx`**:
    - Modified `toggleRecording` function to call `saveSession` automatically after transcription and analysis are complete.
- **`app/page.tsx`**:
    - Replaced the `<h1>` text logo with an `<Image src="/soh.png" ... />` component wrapped in a `<Link href="/">`.
    - Imported `next/image`.
- **`utils/supabase-client.ts`**:
    - Modified to use `createBrowserClient` from `@supabase/ssr` instead of `createClient` from `@supabase/supabase-js`. This was the **key fix** to enable cookie-based session management on the client-side, allowing the session to be shared with server-side components (middleware and API routes).
- **`middleware.ts`**:
    - Enhanced logging was added to trace cookie handling and Supabase user session retrieval. This logging confirmed that Supabase auth cookies were initially missing from incoming requests.
- **`app/api/generate-presentation/route.ts`**:
    - Enhanced logging was added to trace incoming cookies and session state. This also initially showed missing auth cookies and a null session.
- **`components/performance-chart.tsx`**:
    - Removed references to "engagement" score to fix a runtime error.
- **`services/practice-service.ts`**:
    - Explicitly typed the `analysis` field in `PracticeSession` and `PracticeSessionWithDetails` as `AnalysisResult | null` to resolve TypeScript errors in `performance-chart.tsx`.

## Next Steps (When Resuming)
- **Verify PDF Import**: Test the PDF import functionality to ensure it still works correctly.
- **Verify `/history` Page**: Check if the `/history` page now loads correctly without errors after the changes to `performance-chart.tsx` and `practice-service.ts`.
- **Test Auto-Save Functionality**: Thoroughly test the new auto-save feature in `app/practice/page.tsx` under various conditions (e.g., successful transcription/analysis, mock/error transcription).
- **Consider Removing/Reducing Logging**: The detailed logging added to `middleware.ts` and `app/api/generate-presentation/route.ts` can likely be reduced or removed now that the primary issue is resolved, to avoid cluttering server logs.
- **Test `savePracticeSession` (manual and auto)**: Verify that saving practice sessions also works correctly with the authenticated user context and RLS policies for both manual and automatic saves.
- **Verify RLS Policies for `recordings` Storage Bucket**: Ensure appropriate RLS is in place for authenticated users.
- **Continue with other pending tasks** as outlined in `progress.md`.

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- PPTX import is disabled due to unresolved build issues with its dependencies. PDF import is maintained.
- The core issue was the client-side Supabase client not being configured for cookie-based SSR authentication.
- The server-side setup (`middleware.ts` and API routes using `createServerClient`) was largely correct but depended on the client sending the auth cookies.

## Important Patterns & Preferences
- For Next.js applications using Supabase SSR features (middleware, API routes needing auth context), it's crucial to use:
    - `createBrowserClient` (from `@supabase/ssr`) for the client-side Supabase instance.
    - `createServerClient` (from `@supabase/ssr`) for server-side instances (in middleware, API routes, Server Components).
- This ensures consistent cookie-based session management across client and server.

## Learnings & Project Insights
- Dependency issues in third-party libraries can be complex to resolve within a specific build environment (Next.js/Webpack/pnpm). Sometimes, temporarily disabling features reliant on problematic dependencies is a pragmatic approach.
- The choice of Supabase client initialization (`createClient` vs. `createBrowserClient`) is critical for how sessions are persisted (localStorage vs. cookies) and shared in a Next.js SSR context.
- When debugging auth issues, tracing the presence and flow of authentication cookies from the browser through to server-side request handlers is essential.
- RLS policies rely on a valid authenticated session being available to the database. If the session is `null` at the API route level, RLS will typically block operations.
- Ensuring consistent and explicit typing for data structures, especially those derived from database `JSONB` fields (like `practice_sessions.analysis`), is crucial for preventing runtime and type errors in consuming components.
